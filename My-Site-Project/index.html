            <strong>What is a National Forest? </strong>
            <br>
            National forests are largely forest and woodland areas owned collectively by the American people through the federal government and managed by the United States Forest Service, a division of the United States Department of Agriculture.

            <strong>What is Targhee national forest?</strong><br>Caribou-Targhee National Forest is located in the states of Idaho and Wyoming, with a small section in Utah in the United States. 
            The forest is broken into several separate sections and extends over 2.63 million acres. 
            To the east, the forest borders Yellowstone National Park, Grand Teton National Park, and Bridger-Teton National Forest. 
            Most of the forest is a part of the 20-million-acre Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.

            <strong>What is the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache national forest?</strong>
            <br>
            Uinta National Forest is a national forest located in north-central Utah, USA. 
            It was originally part of the Uinta Forest Reserve, created by Grover Cleveland on 2 February 1897. 
            The name is derived from the Ute word Yoov-we-teuh which means pine forest. 
            Because of changes to the boundaries over the years, the Uinta Mountains are now located in the Wasatch-Cache National Forest. 
            In August 2007 it was announced that the Uinta National Forest would merge with the Wasatch-Cache National Forest based in Salt Lake City, Utah, 50 miles north of Provo, Utah.
